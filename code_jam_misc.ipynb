    "### Problem Description\n",
    "After years of study, scientists at Google Labs have discovered an alien\n",
    "language transmitted from a faraway planet. The alien language is very\n",
    "unique in that every word consists of exactly L lowercase letters. Also,\n",
    "there are exactly D words in this language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the dictionary of all the words in the alien language was built,\n",
    "the next breakthrough was to discover that the aliens have been\n",
    "transmitting messages to Earth for the past decade. Unfortunately, these\n",
    "signals are weakened due to the distance between our two planets and some\n",
    "of the words may be misinterpreted. In order to help them decipher these\n",
    "messages, the scientists have asked you to devise an algorithm that will\n",
    "determine the number of possible interpretations for a given pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pattern consists of exactly L tokens. Each token is either a single\n",
    "lowercase letter (the scientists are very sure that this is the letter)\n",
    "or a group of unique lowercase letters surrounded by parenthesis ( and ).\n",
    "For example: (ab)d(dc) means the first letter is either a or b, the second\n",
    "letter is definitely d and the last letter is either d or c. Therefore,\n",

    "Input\n",

    "The first line of input contains 3 integers, L, D and N separated by a\n",

    "In A.D. 2100, aliens came to Earth. They wrote a message in a cryptic \n",
    "language, and next to it they wrote a series of symbols. We've come to \n",
    "the conclusion that the symbols indicate a number: the number of seconds \n",
    "before war begins!\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately we have no idea what each symbol means. We've decided that \n",
    "each symbol indicates one digit, but we aren't sure what each digit means \n",
    "or what base the aliens are using. For example, if they wrote \"ab2ac999\", \n",
    "they could have meant \"31536000\" in base 10 -- exactly one year -- or they \n",
    "could have meant \"12314555\" in base 6 -- 398951 seconds, or about four and \n",
    "a half days. We are sure of three things: the number is positive; like us, \n",
    "the aliens will never start a number with a zero; and they aren't using \n",

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "Geologists sometimes divide an area of land into different regions based on where rainfall flows down to. These regions are called drainage basins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an elevation map (a 2-dimensional array of altitudes), label the map such that locations in the same drainage basin have the same label, subject to the following rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "From each cell, water flows down to at most one of its 4 neighboring cells.\n",
    "For each cell, if none of its 4 neighboring cells has a lower altitude than the current cell's, then the water does not flow, and the current cell is called a sink.\n",
    "Otherwise, water flows from the current cell to the neighbor with the lowest altitude.\n",
    "In case of a tie, water will choose the first direction with the lowest altitude from this list: North, West, East, South.\n",
    "Every cell that drains directly or indirectly to the same sink is part of the same drainage basin. Each basin is labeled by a unique lower-case letter, in such a way that, when the rows of the map are concatenated from top to bottom, the resulting string is lexicographically smallest. (In particular, the basin of the most North-Western cell is always labeled 'a'.)\n",
    "Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of the input file will contain the number of maps, T. T maps will follow, each starting with two integers on a line -- H and W -- the height and width of the map, in cells. The next H lines will each contain a row of the map, from north to south, each containing W integers, from west to east, specifying the altitudes of the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case, output 1+H lines. The first line must be of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "Case #X:\n",
    "where X is the test case number, starting from 1. The next H lines must list the basin labels for each of the cells, in the same order as they appear in the input.\n",
